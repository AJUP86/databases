    - Delete item(s) in ToDo list
    - Create a new ToDo list
    - Delete a ToDo list
    - Mark an item as completed
    - Add a reminder for the list (not for the item)
- Write the necessary SQL statements/commands to maintain the state of the database.
- Use PostMan to test the APIs.
### Features
Choose at least 2 of these features
- A user should be able to tag a ToDo item with a label (the label comes from a fixed set of pre-defined labels, but the user should also be able to edit the set of labels)
- A user should be able to edit the items in another person's list, but not anyone else's reminders
- A user should be able to select all of another person's ToDo lists and create a reminder for them
- A user should be able to select whether they want to be sent a reminder 

### What to submit
